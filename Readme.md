# Arc Reactor

This a "simple" model for an arc reactor in FreeCAD, there's included pieces in stl and .step
Maybe some super glue could be needed.
Attention: I never printed this model, I created based only on images that are in the folder

I do not design the pictures I took from someone in www.deviantart.com
